Mason Garrison 2021-01-04 Welcome to PSY 703: Week 0 Welcome to class! This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrisons Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P). DS4P is a graduate-level quantitative methods course at Wake Forest University. This website hosts the course notes and lecture materials. All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a youtube playlist. You can find the current version of the course syllabus here, along with all of the other syllabi for my classes. library(vembedr) embed_url(&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYYJmmcgzr8&quot;) %&gt;% use_align(&quot;center&quot;) 0.1 Course Introduction Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P) introduces on the principles of data science, including: data wrangling, modeling, visualization, and communication. In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description, rather than confirmatory analyses and prediction. Through the semester we will work our way thru Wickham and Grolemunds R for Data Science text and develop proficiency with tidyverse. This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. DS4P is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., valence analysis). 0.2 Big Ideas This class cover the following broad five areas: Reproducibility; Replication; Robust Methods; Resplendent Visualizations; and R Programming. 0.3 Materials 0.3.1 Hardware This class is requires that you have a laptop that can run R. 0.3.2 Required Texts The text is intended to supplement the videos, lecture notes, and in-class tutorials. You need to consume all four in order to be successful in this class. R for Data Science text (???) 0.3.3 Software 0.3.3.1 R R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows, and MacOS. 0.3.3.2 R Studio RStudio is a free integrated development environment (IDE), a powerful user interface for R. 0.3.3.3 Git Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files  called a repository  in a structured way. Think of it like the Track Changes features from Microsoft Word. 0.3.3.4 Github Github is a free IDE and hosting service for Git. 0.4 Course Modality This class is a blended class. The online portions are asynchronous. Ive created a video highlighting how to be a successful asynchronous learner. Much of this information comes from Northeastern Universitys Tips for Taking Online Classes 0.5 Attribution This class leans heavily on other peoples materials and ideas. I have done my best to document the origin of the materials and ideas. They include: Jenny Bryans (jennybryan.org) STAT 545; Joe Rodgerss PSY 8751 Exploratory and Graphical Data Analysis Course Julia Fukuyamas EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS You can see specific changes by examining the edit history on the git repo STAT 545 Jenny Bryans (jennybryan.org) STAT 545 course is from the University of British Columbia. The STAT 545 course became notable as an early example of a data science course taught in a statistics program. It is also notable for its focus on teaching using modern R packages, Git and GitHub, its extensive sharing of teaching materials openly online, and its strong emphasis on practical data cleaning, exploration, and visualization skills, rather than algorithms and theory.  Wikipedia PSY 8751 Joe Rodgerss EXPLORATORY and GRAPHICAL DATA ANALYSIS course was developed at the University of Oklahoma. I took his class while a graduate student at Vanderbilt University. Stat 470/670 Julia Fukuyamas EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS is an R based class. Shes an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University. Colophon This book was written in bookdown inside RStudio. The website r-computing-lab.github.io/DataScience4Psych is hosted with github, The complete source is available from GitHub. The Psych 703 logo was designed by me and the book style was designed by Desir√©e De Leon. This version of the book was built with: #&gt; Finding R package dependencies ...

"],["install.html", "Unit 1 Install R and RStudio 1.1 R and RStudio 1.2 Testing testing 1.3 Add-on packages 1.4 Further resources", " Unit 1 Install R and RStudio 1.1 R and RStudio Install R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system  use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above! Install RStudios IDE (stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user interface for R. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop. You can run either the Preview version or the official releases available here. RStudio comes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a separate stand-alone editor. RStudio can interface with Git(Hub). However, you must do all the Git(Hub) set up described elsewhere before you can take advantage of this. If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, I highly recommend that you reinstall both and get as current as possible. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. If you upgrade R, you will need to update any packages you have installed. The command below should get you started, though you may need to specify more arguments if, e.g., you have been using a non-default library for your packages. update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE) Note: this will only look for updates on CRAN. So if you use a package that lives only on GitHub or if you want a development version from GitHub, you will need to update manually, e.g. via devtools::install_github(). 1.2 Testing testing Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see here, but yours will be more boring because you havent written any code or made any figures yet! Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like x &lt;- 2 * 4 (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the x object by typing x followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, youve succeeded in installing R and RStudio. 1.3 Add-on packages R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a package via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the dplyr package for data manipulation, here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others). install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) By including dependencies = TRUE, we are being explicit and extra-careful to install any additional packages the target package, dplyr in the example above, needs to have around. You could use the above method to install the following packages, all of which we will use: tidyr, package webpage ggplot2, package webpage 1.4 Further resources The above will get your basic setup ready but here are some links if you are interested in reading a bit further.
