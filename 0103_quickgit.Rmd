# Quick Starting with Github {#quickhappygit}

One of the goals for this course is to familiarize yourself with Git and GitHub. This section a much shorter version of a document you'll find later in the class. The unabridged version is a fusion of GitHub Classroom's github-starter-course and Jenny Bryan's [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/). I *strongly* encourage you to check out the unabridged version of happygit as it has so much more detail. Alternatively, if you'd rather not read, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE) video by [Jess Chan](https://coder-coder.com/about/) of [Coder Coder](https://coder-coder.com/) is extremely helpful in getting you started.

## The Basics of GitHub and Git

### What is Git?

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you've worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier---groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

### What is GitHub?

GitHub extends Git's capabilities by providing a web-based interface for collaboration. It's widely used for code development, allowing multiple people to work together on projects. GitHub hosts your repositories (project folders) and provides tools for managing changes, reviewing code, and collaborating with others.

### Getting Started with GitHub

-   Create a GitHub Account: Sign up at github.com. Choose a thoughtful username as it represents you in the GitHub community.

-   Install Git: To interact with GitHub, install Git. Find instructions for Windows and macOS.

## Understanding the GitHub flow

The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.

#### Key Terms:

-   Repository: Your project's digital directory on GitHub.

-   Clone: Copying a repository to your computer.

-   Commit: Recording changes to your files in the repository.

-   Push: Uploading local repository changes to GitHub.

#### Repositories

A repository is where your project work happens--think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project's files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.

#### Cloning

When a repository is created with GitHub, it's stored remotely in the ‚òÅÔ∏è. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

#### Committing and pushing

**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor or teammates can see your latest work when you're ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to "checkpoint." You can also add a helpful **commit message** to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. "Added a README with information about our project").

Once you have a commit or multiple commits that you're ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you'll get used to it üôÇ

## üíª GitHub terms to know

### Repositories

We mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let's talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your ["GitHub dashboard"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-your-personal-dashboard) helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you're logged in to see it!

Repositories also contain **README**s. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. üòÑ

To learn more about repositories read ["Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories) and ["About README's"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes).

### Branches

You can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository---main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository.

To learn more about branching, read ["About Branches"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches).

### Forks

A fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else's project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects!

To learn more about forking, read ["Fork a repo"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

### Pull requests

When working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch.

To learn more about pull requests, read ["About Pull Requests"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Issues

Issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!

For larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them [in this "About Project boards document](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards). You likely won't need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they're a great way to organize your team's work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.

To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read ["About Issues"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues).

### Your user profile

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you!

To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

### Using markdown on GitHub

You might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. ["Markdown"](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point!

To learn more about using GitHub's flavor of markdown, read ["Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

#### Browsing GitHub Explore

GitHub Explore is a great place to do just that ... explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with. You can check out the GitHub Explore website [at github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore). The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be.

## Half the battle {#install-intro}

Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle when first adopting Git. Brace yourself for some pain. The upside is that you can give yourself a pat on the back once you get through this. And you WILL get through this.

You will find far more resources for how to *use Git* than for installation and configuration. Why? The experts ...

-   Have been doing this for years. It's simply not hard for them anymore.
-   Probably use some flavor of Unix. They may secretly (or not so secretly) take pride in neither using nor knowing Windows.
-   Get more satisfaction and reward for thinking and writing about Git concepts and workflows than Git installation.

In their defense, it's hard to write installation instructions. Failures can be specific to an individual OS or even individual computer.

### Username advice

You will be able to upgrade to a paid level of service, apply discounts, join organizations, etc. in the future, so don't fret about any of that now. **Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.**

A few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:

-   Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
-   Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
-   Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
-   Shorter is better than longer.
-   Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
-   Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.
-   Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming. In Jenny's first inept efforts to script around the GitHub API, she assigned lots of issues to [the guy with username `NA`](https://github.com/na) because my vector of GitHub usernames contained missing values. A variant of [Little Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/).
-   Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen `-` or underscore `_`.

You can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.

-   Students, faculty, and educational/research staff: [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com).

-   GitHub "Organizations" can be extremely useful for courses or research/lab groups,

    -   where you need some coordination across a set of repos and users.

-   Official nonprofit organizations and charities: [GitHub for Good](https://github.com/nonprofit)

### What is a Git client? Why would you want one?

"Git" is really just a collection of individual commands you execute in the shell. This interface is not appealing for everyone. Some may prefer to do Git operations via a client with a graphical interface.

Git and your Git client are not the same thing, just like R and RStudio are not the same thing. A Git client and an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), such as RStudio, are not necessary to use Git or R, respectively. But they make the experience more pleasant because they reduce the amount of [command line bullshittery](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm) and provide a richer visual representation of the current state.

RStudio offers a very basic Git client via its Git pane. I use this often for simple operations, but you probably want another, more powerful one as well.

Fair warning: for some tasks, you must use the command line. But the more powerful your Git client is, the less often this happens. The visual overview given by your Git client can also be invaluable for understanding the current state of things, even when preparing calls to command line Git.

Fantastic news: because all of the clients are just forming and executing Git commands on your behalf, you don't have to pick one. You can literally do one operation from the command line, do another from RStudio, and another from SourceTree, one after the other, and it just works. *Very rarely, both clients will scan the repo at the same time and you'll get an error message about `.git/index.lock`. Try the operation again at least once before doing any further troubleshooting.*

### A picture is worth a thousand words

Here's a screenshot of SourceTree (see below) open to the repository for this site. You get a nice graphical overview of the recent commit history, branches, and diffs, as well as a GUI that facilitates the most common Git operations.

![SourceTree screenshot](img/sourcetree-screenshot.png)

In contrast, here's a shell session where I've used command line Git to access some of the same information.

![Command line Git](img/command-line-git-screenshot.png)

Which do you prefer?

### No one is giving out Git Nerd merit badges

Work with Git in whatever way makes you most effective. Feel free to revisit your approach over time or to use different approaches for different tasks. No one can tell whether you use the command line or a GUI when they look at your Git history or your GitHub repo.

If your Git life happens on your own computer, there is no reason to deny yourself a GUI if that's what you like. If you prefer working in the shell or if you frequently log into a remote server, then it makes sense to prioritize building Git skills at the command line. Do whatever works for you, but don't do anything for the sake of purity or heroism.

### Git clients
-   GitHub offers a free Git(Hub) client, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), for Windows and macOS. GitHub Desktop is aimed at beginners who want the most useful features of Git front and center. The flipside is that it may not support some of the more advanced workflows exposed by the clients above. At present, this client is what *I*, Mason, mostly use.
