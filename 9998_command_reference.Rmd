Below is a list of R commands along with links to their help pages:

- [`summary()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/4.1.0/topics/summary): Provides summary statistics for numeric data.
- [`plot()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/4.1.0/topics/plot): Creates various types of plots.
- [`lm()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/4.1.0/topics/lm): Fits linear regression models.
- [`read.csv()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/4.1.0/topics/read.table): Reads a CSV file into a data frame.
- [`install.packages()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/4.1.0/topics/install.packages): Installs R packages from CRAN.

You can add more commands to the list as needed. Simply include the command name within backticks (`command()`), and provide the corresponding help page URL in the link text.

Save the above code in an R Markdown file (e.g., `command_reference.Rmd`) and knit it to an HTML document. The resulting HTML file will display the list of R commands with clickable links to their respective help pages.

Remember to replace the example links with the appropriate URLs for the commands you want to include in your reference. You can find the help page URLs for specific R functions on the official R documentation website (https://www.rdocumentation.org/).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
