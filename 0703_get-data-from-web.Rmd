# Data usually finds me

Eventually, I'm going to write up my SAM talk on "I don't go looking for Data … Data usually finds me," from last year. However, in the meantime, here is a [link to the slides of that talk](https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/DataScience4Psych/raw/main/admin/pdfs/sam_vfinal.pdf).

## I don’t go looking for Data … Data usually finds me
