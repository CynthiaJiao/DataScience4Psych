# Welcome to PSY 703 {-}

Welcome to class! This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison's Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P). DS4P is a graduate-level quantitative methods course at Wake Forest University. This class assumes zero knowledge of programming, computer science, linear algebra, probability, or really anything fancy. I encourage anyone who is quant-curious to work their way through these course notes. The course notes include lectures, worked examples, readings, activities, and labs. You can find the current version of the course syllabus [here][course_syllabus], along with all of the [other syllabi for my classes][syllabi]. All the embedded lecture videos can be found on a [youtube playlist][pl_all].
