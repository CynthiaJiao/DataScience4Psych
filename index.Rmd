Welcome to class! This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison's Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P) graduate course at Wake Forest University. This website is both the syllabus and primary lecture materials. 

## Course Description {-}

Data Science for Psychologists (DS4P) introduces on the principles of data science, including:

* data wrangling, 
* modeling, 
* visualization, and 
* communication. 


In this class, we link those principles to psychological methods and open science practices by emphasizing exploratory analyses and description. Through the semester we will work our way thru [Wickham and Grolemund's R for Data Science text](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and develop proficiency with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This class emphasizes replication and reproducibility. DS4P is a practical skilled-based class and should be useful to students aiming for academia as well as those interested in industry. Applications of these methods can be applied to a full range of psychological areas, including perception (e.g, eye-tracking data), neuroscience (e.g., visualizing neural networks), and individual differences (e.g., valence analysis).

## Broad Topics {-}
This class cover the following broad five areas:

* Reproducibility;
* Replication;
* Robust Methods;
* Resplendent Visualizations; and
* R Programming.


## Materials {-}

This class is very technology heavy
<sentence of difference between minimum, recommended, and mason. Minimum is the bare minimum that you need to function in the class. Recommended are the what I think you need in order to succeed. Mason are the levels that I am currently using. In general what I am using is beyond what any reasonable person needs. I include it primarily as a curiosity and more evidence of my "too-muchness">

### Texts {-}

The text is intended to supplement the videos, lecture notes, and in-class tutorials. You need to consume all four in order to be successful in this class.

### Software {-}

#### R {-}

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.




#### R Studio {-}

#### GitHub {-}

## Origins {-}

This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis **except for statistical modeling and inference**. This might strike you as strange, given R's statistical roots. First, let me assure you we believe that modeling and inference are important. But the world already offers a lot of great resources for doing statistics with R.

The design of PSY 703 was motivated by the need to provide more balance in applied statistical training. Data analysts spend a considerable amount of time on project organization, data cleaning and preparation, and communication. These activities can have a profound effect on the quality and credibility of an analysis. Yet these skills are rarely taught, despite how important and necessary they are. PSY 703 aims to address this gap.



## Attribution {-}

This class leans heavily on other peoples' materials and ideas. I have done my best to document the origin of the materials and ideas. They include: 

* Jenny Bryan's ([jennybryan.org](https://jennybryan.org)) [STAT 545](https://www.Stat545.com);

* Joe Rodgers's PSY 8751 Exploratory and Graphical Data Analysis Course



### STAT 545 {-}

Jenny Bryan's ([jennybryan.org](https://jennybryan.org)) [STAT 545](https://www.Stat545.com) course is from the University of British Columbia.

> "The STAT 545 course became notable as an early example of a data science course taught in a statistics program. It is also notable for its focus on teaching using modern R packages, Git and GitHub, its extensive sharing of teaching materials openly online, and its strong emphasis on practical data cleaning, exploration, and visualization skills, rather than algorithms and theory."

### PSY 8751 {-}

Joe Rodgers's EXPLORATORY and GRAPHICAL DATA ANALYSIS course was developed at the University of Oklahoma. I took his class while a graduate student at Vanderbilt University.

## Colophon {-}

This book was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The website [r-computing-lab.github.io/DataScience4Psych](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/DataScience4Psych) is hosted with [github](https://www.github.com), The complete source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab/DataScience4Psych).

The [Psych 703](assets/logo.png) was designed by me and the book style was designed by [Desir√©e De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/).

This version of the book was built with:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$platform
```

Along with these packages:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(session$packages), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))
```
