# Welcome to Psy 703 {-}

Learn how to:

* explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data,
* make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable,
* using R.

This site is about everything that comes up during data analysis **except for statistical modeling and inference**. This might strike you as strange, given R's statistical roots. First, let me assure you we believe that modeling and inference are important. But the world already offers a lot of great resources for doing statistics with R.

The design of STAT 545 was motivated by the need to provide more balance in applied statistical training. Data analysts spend a considerable amount of time on project organization, data cleaning and preparation, and communication. These activities can have a profound effect on the quality and credibility of an analysis. Yet these skills are rarely taught, despite how important and necessary they are. STAT 545 aims to address this gap.

## Foundations {-}


This class leans heavily on materials developed by others. I have done my best to document the origin of the materials. These materials include 
Jenny Bryan's ([jennybryan.org](https://jennybryan.org)) [STAT 545](https://www.Stat545.com) course from the University of British Columbia:

> "The STAT 545 course became notable as an early example of a data science course taught in a statistics program. It is also notable for its focus on teaching using modern R packages, Git and GitHub, its extensive sharing of teaching materials openly online, and its strong emphasis on practical data cleaning, exploration, and visualization skills, rather than algorithms and theory."

## Colophon {-}

This book was written in [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/) inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). The website [r-computing-lab.github.io/DataScience4Psych](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/DataScience4Psych) is hosted with [github](https://www.github.com), The complete source is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab/DataScience4Psych).

The [Psych 703](assets/logo.png) and the book style was designed by me.

This version of the book was built with:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$platform
```

Along with these packages:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(session$packages), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))
```
