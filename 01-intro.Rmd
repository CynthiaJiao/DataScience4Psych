# Introduction {#intro}

Welcome to class! This website is designed to accompany Mason Garrison's Data Science for Psychologists graduate course at Wake Forest University. It is both the syllabus and primary textbook. 

## Course Description
This course focuses on the basic principles of data science and linking them to traditional psychological approaches. Along the way, we will develop an understanding of R programming as well as open science practices. In general, data science focuses on exploratory analyses and description rather than on corfirmatory analyses and prediction. Through the semester we will work our way thru [Wickham and Grolemund's R for Data Science text](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and develop proficiency with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

This class cover the following broad five areas:
* Reproducibility;
* Replication;
* Robust Methods;
* Resplendent Visualizations; and
* R Programming.
