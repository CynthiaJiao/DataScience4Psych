Getting all the necessary software installed, configured, and playing nicely together is honestly half the battle when first adopting Git. Brace yourself for some pain. The upside is that you can give yourself a pat on the back once you get through this. And you WILL get through this.

You will find far more resources for how to *use Git* than for installation and configuration. Why? The experts ...

- Have been doing this for years. It's simply not hard for them anymore.
- Probably use some flavor of Unix. They may secretly (or not so secretly) take pride in neither using nor knowing Windows.
- Get more satisfaction and reward for thinking and writing about Git concepts and workflows than Git installation.

In their defense, it's hard to write installation instructions. Failures can be specific to an individual OS or even individual computer.
