### What is Git?

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you've worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier---groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

### What is GitHub?

GitHub extends Git's capabilities by providing a web-based interface for collaboration. It's widely used for code development, allowing multiple people to work together on projects. GitHub hosts your repositories (project folders) and provides tools for managing changes, reviewing code, and collaborating with others.
